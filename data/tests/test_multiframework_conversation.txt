User: Build a full-stack application with React frontend and Django backend
Assistant: I'll help you build a full-stack application. Let me start with the architecture.

User: Use Redux for state management and PostgreSQL for database
Assistant: Great choices. I'll set up the tech stack.

Step 1: Created file frontend/src/App.tsx (React + TypeScript)
Step 2: Created file frontend/src/store/index.ts (Redux Toolkit)
Step 3: Created file backend/settings.py (Django configuration)
Step 4: Created file backend/models.py (SQLAlchemy models)
Step 5: Created file docker-compose.yml (Docker + PostgreSQL)

Key decisions made:
- Decision: Use React with TypeScript
  Rationale: Type safety and better developer experience
  Source: React documentation

- Decision: Use Redux Toolkit for state management
  Rationale: Simplified Redux with less boilerplate
  Source: Redux Toolkit best practices

- Decision: Use PostgreSQL with TimescaleDB extension
  Rationale: Time-series data optimization
  Source: TimescaleDB documentation

Technical implementation:

# Frontend (React + Redux)
import { configureStore } from '@reduxjs/toolkit'
import { Provider } from 'react-redux'

const store = configureStore({
  reducer: {
    user: userReducer,
    posts: postsReducer
  }
})

function App() {
  return (
    <Provider store={store}>
      <Router>
        <Routes />
      </Router>
    </Provider>
  )
}

# Backend (Django + SQLAlchemy)
from django.db import models
from sqlalchemy import create_engine

class User(models.Model):
    username = models.CharField(max_length=100)
    email = models.EmailField()
    created_at = models.DateTimeField(auto_now_add=True)

# Database (PostgreSQL + TimescaleDB)
CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS timescaledb;
CREATE TABLE metrics (
    time TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL,
    value DOUBLE PRECISION
);
SELECT create_hypertable('metrics', 'time');

# DevOps (Docker + Kubernetes)
FROM node:18-alpine as frontend
WORKDIR /app
COPY package*.json ./
RUN npm install
COPY . .
RUN npm run build

FROM python:3.11-slim as backend
WORKDIR /app
COPY requirements.txt .
RUN pip install -r requirements.txt

Git commits:
- commit 1: test(TDD-Red): Add integration tests
- commit 2: feat(TDD-Green): Implement React frontend
- commit 3: feat(TDD-Green): Implement Django backend
- commit 4: feat(DevOps): Add Docker and Kubernetes configs

User: Add Tailwind CSS for styling and Playwright for E2E testing
Assistant: I'll add Tailwind CSS and Playwright to the stack.

Created file tailwind.config.js
Created file tests/e2e/login.spec.ts (Playwright tests)
Modified frontend/src/index.css (Tailwind imports)

Testing strategy:
- Unit tests: Jest + React Testing Library
- E2E tests: Playwright
- API tests: Pytest + FastAPI TestClient

Cost estimate:
- AWS deployment: ~$50/month
- Vercel frontend: Free
- Heroku PostgreSQL: $9/month
Total: ~$59/month
